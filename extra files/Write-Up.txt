# 🧠 FX-Aware Marketing & Pricing Strategy Agent

## Problem Statement

For global enterprises in consumer electronics, pricing decisions across countries and currencies remain manual, ad-hoc, and fragmented. Pricing teams spend hours crunching numbers in spreadsheets and emails: gathering cost data, converting currencies, checking competitor prices, and building FX scenarios.

The workflow looks like:

- Gather procurement cost in local currency and convert with current FX rates  💱
- Collect competitor prices from dashboards or reports 📊  
- Model a few currency scenarios (e.g. base, favorable, adverse) in Excel  
- Calculate margins and experiment with candidate prices  
- Compile recommendations in an email or slide deck  

Doing this for dozens of SKUs across multiple regions is slow and error-prone ⚠️. It often underestimates currency risk and offers little transparency. The process is hard to scale and lacks an audit trail: each decision is buried in fragmented spreadsheets and emails.

This causes major pain points:

- **Under-modeled FX risk**: Critical assumptions live in personal spreadsheets, not in a shared, audit-friendly system.  
- **Fragmented logic**: Market data, competitor intel, and currency scenarios live in silos (dashboards, local teams, Excel).  
- **Slow and manual**: Managers waste time re-hashing old data and formatting slide decks instead of focusing on strategy.  
- **Scalability issues**: There’s no easy way to run this analysis for hundreds of products at once.  

These issues translate to lost margin and agility (💸), making FX-aware pricing an ideal challenge for automation.

## Why Agents?

Traditional scripts or single-model solutions struggle with this multi-step decision process. We needed a solution that can reason like a team of analysts.

AI agents provide a powerful framework to orchestrate complex tasks and embed domain knowledge. Each agent is a specialized “expert” (for example, on market research, FX, or margin calculation) and can use tools or external data. A top-level Orchestrator agent coordinates these experts in a workflow.

This agent-based architecture offers:

- **Specialized reasoning**: Individual agents focus on one task (e.g. gathering competitor prices or forecasting FX), mirroring how human teams operate.  
- **Tool integration**: Agents can invoke custom utilities (currency converter, charting, memory lookups) or web services for live market data.  
- **Explainability & audit trails**: The pipeline produces structured outputs (decision briefs, JSON reports) at each step, making the reasoning transparent.  
- **Scalability & parallelism**: The same pipeline handles one SKU or 1,000+ SKUs without modification 🚀, enabling portfolio-level analysis.  
- **Flexibility**: New agents or rules can be added easily (e.g. supporting new markets or factors), fitting enterprise agility.  

Using LLM-powered agents also lets us leverage natural language to generate clear, human-readable recommendations and analyses.

## What You Created

We built a multi-agent LLM system called the **FX-Aware Marketing & Pricing Strategy Agent**. The core pipeline, orchestrated by a top-level agent, handles a product pricing request end-to-end.

Given inputs (device name, region, procurement cost & currency, target margin, current price), the orchestrator invokes a sequence of specialized agents:

- **Market Research Agent**: Collects market context and competitor positioning using search tools. It compiles a summary of device specs and market demand trends 📈.  
- **Competitive Pricing Agent**: Retrieves competitor prices for the product in the target market and summarizes the competitive landscape.  
- **FX Impact Agent**: Builds FX rate scenarios (base/adverse/favorable) and recalculates landed cost in local currency. It highlights currency risk (e.g. “If USD weakens 10%, costs rise ~X%”) 💹.  
- **Margin Planner Agent**: Explores candidate pricing in each scenario and simulates margins, identifying a price or range that meets the target margin.  
- **Decision Brief Agent**: Drafts a concise executive summary recommending a pricing strategy (match/undercut/premium) and a specific price. The brief explains the rationale, risk factors, and key numbers 📋.  
- **Evaluation Agent**: Checks that outputs are coherent and complete. It reviews the decision brief and data summary for consistency and flags any issues.  

Under the hood, we developed custom domain tools in Python, for example:

- Currency conversion utilities  
- Market snapshot and competitor lookup tools  
- Margin calculation utilities  

We also built:

- 💾**Session & Memory Management**: A long-term memory service remembers past pricing analyses by product/region. This lets the system recall historical decisions and trends.  
- 🔍 **Observability**: A logging plugin tracks each agent’s calls, token usage, and timing, providing metrics for monitoring.  
- 📈 **Scalable Batch Runs**: The same agents can process a portfolio of devices. We include a batch test harness that simulates 1,000-device runs, measuring throughput and coverage.  

The result is an end-to-end pipeline where AI agents replace the manual analysis flow. The system outputs both a clear written recommendation and a structured JSON report, ready for downstream integration.

## Demo

We demonstrate the agent on a realistic launch scenario: a high-end laptop (e.g. “MacBook Pro”) launching in the US, procured in CNY (China). The user asked:

> “Evaluate FX risk, margin vs competitors, and recommend a price for the launch.”

The pipeline ran end-to-end and produced:

- 📝**Decision Brief**: An English summary recommending a price (e.g. “$X”), the suggested pricing strategy, and explanations. It noted FX considerations (e.g. if USD weakens, margin impact) and competitor prices.  
- 📊 **Structured Summary (JSON)**: A machine-readable output listing the final price, projected margin, currency scenarios, and risk flags. This can feed directly into reports or dashboards.  
- ✅**Evaluation Report**: The evaluation agent’s check that the recommendation meets targets and is factually consistent.  

This demo shows the agent doing in seconds what normally takes teams hours. The notebook output includes a full breakdown of the agent’s reasoning steps and answers. In practice, a business user can quickly see a recommended price and rationale, rather than wading through spreadsheets.

## The Build

We implemented the solution in a Kaggle notebook using Google’s Generative AI SDK (GenAI) and custom Python code.

Key components include:

- ⚙️ **Tech Stack**: Google GenAI (Gemini) models via the `google_genai` library for LLM access, along with standard data and web libraries.  
- 🤖**Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Each agent is defined as an LLM-based tool with prompts and functions. The Orchestrator agent is an LLM chain that sequentially invokes the specialists. Agents communicate via an asynchronous pipeline.  
- 🛠️ **Custom Tools**: Domain logic is encapsulated in Python functions: market data snapshots, competitor lookup, FX scenario calculator, margin calculator, etc. Agents call these tools for reliable data and computations.  
- 💾**Memory & State**: We built an in-memory datastore that keeps session context and historical results. A specialized “Memory” agent can store summaries of past runs and retrieve them in new analyses, providing context continuity.  
- 📊 **Observability**: A custom logging plugin records each agent’s input/output and token usage. We log structured outputs at each stage, which serves as an audit trail and debugging aid. Smoke tests exercise each agent’s functionality.  
- 🧪**Testing & Evaluation**: We designed a test suite with realistic scenarios. For example, a batch test creates 1,000 sample devices and runs the pipeline to measure performance. A dedicated evaluation agent verifies output quality (consistency, coverage, actionability). Metrics like execution time and token counts are tracked.  

All code is organized with sections for setup, tools, agent definitions, and the final pipeline. The architecture diagram in the notebook illustrates the workflow from Orchestrator → specialist agents → evaluator. We also fixed random seeds and reset session state between runs to ensure reproducibility, an important enterprise requirement.

## If I Had More Time

Future improvements to enhance this enterprise solution include:

- 🌐**Real Data Integration**: Connect agents to live APIs and databases (e.g. real-time FX rates, ERP for actual costs, scraping current competitor pricing) to use up-to-date inputs.  
- .
🤖 **Enhanced Memory & ML**: Store historical pricing outcomes and use machine learning to refine recommendations. Fine-tune or reinforce the LLM agents on our data for more accuracy.  
- 💻 **UI & Automation**: Develop a user-friendly interface or REST API so business users can submit product data and get interactive reports. Integrate with dashboards for visualizing outputs.  
- ➕**Additional Agents**: Add specialists for inventory constraints, promotion/coupon planning, or demand forecasting. Support localization or multiple product categories.  
- 📈 **Performance & Robustness**: Optimize the pipeline for larger volumes (multi-threading, caching) and improve error handling (e.g. retry logic). Implement more evaluation metrics (ROI impact, user feedback).  
- 🔒 **Security & Compliance**: In an enterprise deployment, add audit logging (track who initiated requests), access controls, and ensure data privacy for sensitive information.  

In summary, our prototype shows how AI agents can automate a critical enterprise workflow. With more time, we’d refine it into a production-grade pricing assistant.
