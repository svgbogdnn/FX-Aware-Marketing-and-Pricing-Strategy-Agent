Defines a synthesis agent that converts analytical outputs into an executive-ready decision brief.

It receives four structured inputs:

- market research summary,
- competitive pricing analysis,
- FX impact scenarios,
- and margin scenarios.

The agent then:

- weaves these inputs into a coherent narrative tailored to marketing and procurement managers,
- highlights key insights, risks, and recommended actions,
- and produces a companion STRUCTURED_SUMMARY_JSON object that mirrors the narrative in a machine-readable format.

This agent is the bridge between raw analytical artifacts and a clear, human-friendly recommendation that can be used directly in decision meetings.
