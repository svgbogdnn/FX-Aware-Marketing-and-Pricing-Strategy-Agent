Defines the core set of LLM agents used in the FX-aware pricing system.  
Each agent has a focused, business-aligned role and a carefully designed instruction, so that the overall multi-agent pipeline stays interpretable, testable, and easy to extend.

The agents in this section cover the full decision-making chain:

- understanding the market and competitors,
- quantifying FX and margin impact,
- synthesizing an executive-ready decision brief,
- and evaluating the quality of the final output.

Together, they form a coherent “team” that mirrors how human analysts would collaborate on FX-aware pricing decisions.
