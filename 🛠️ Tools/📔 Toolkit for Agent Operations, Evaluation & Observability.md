This toolkit groups operational and monitoring helpers around the agent:

- conversation export and reset utilities,
- configuration and search helpers,
- batch execution and automatic summarization,
- feedback capture and basic response quality checks,
- performance tracking and export.

The goal is to make the agent easier to operate like a “mini production service”: runs can be inspected, reset, tuned and evaluated without changing core business logic.
